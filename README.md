# IPL-data-analysis
Hi Everyone !

As we know data visualizations make big and small data easier for the people to understand, and also make it easier to detect patterns, trends, and outliers in groups of data.

Good data visualizations should place meaning into complicated datasets so that their message is clear and concise.

I am extremely delighted to share that I have completed the 6th Task of my internship with The Sparks Foundation.

on IPL sports Analytics.
